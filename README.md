#### Part 1 - Data Preparation

Implemented this step using two different structures:

- Instanced the CIFAR10 dataset, passed it through a method that assigns noised labels to a deepcopy of the dataset
- Instanced the CIFAR10 dataset through a subclass that inherits the CIFAR10 class. An user defined method in the subclass was used to then noisify the dataset
